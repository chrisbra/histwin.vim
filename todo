Todo List for the histwin plugin

- Do we really need to include only the items from the undotree(), that have an
  'alt' key? Or what is the best way to identify the branches from the
  undotree() function? (currently we are cheating and take only the items from
  the undolist into account)
- make tags permanent (needs patch for Vim)
  (should be done with 0.20)
- Bugfix: Sometimes the histwin window contains invalid data, not sure how to
  reproduce it. Closing and reopening is the workaround.
- Open old versions in new tab/window
- Sometimes the initial entry is wrong.
  (should be done with 0.20)
- Is changenr() not the right tool, to determine where one stays in the
  undotree?
