Todo List for the histwin plugin

- Do we really need to include only the items from the undotree(), that have an
  'alt' key? Or what is the best way to identify the branches from the
  undotree() function? (currently we are cheating and take only the items from
  the undolist into account)
- make tags permanent (needs patch for Vim)
- Bugfix: Sometimes the histwin window contains invalid data, not sure how to
  reproduce it. Closing and reoping is the workaround.
- Open old versions in new tab/window
- Sometime the initial entry is wrong.
