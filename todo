Todo List for the histwin plugin

- Do we really need to include only the items from the undotree(), that have an
  'alt' key? Or what is the best way to identify the branches from the
  undotree() function? (currently we are cheating and take only the items from
  the undolist into account)
- make tags permanent (needs patch for Vim)
- rewrite script and make use of undotree() functionality that is available
  since Vim 7.3 (should work now)
- Bugfix: Sometimes the histwin window contains invalid data, not sure how to
  reproduce it. Closing and reoping is the workaround.
- Open old versions in new tab/window
- Bugfix: plugin errors, when there is no history available for the buffer
