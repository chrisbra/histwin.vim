Todo List for the histwin plugin

- Do we really need to include only the items from the undotree(), that have an 'alt' key?
  Or what is the best way to identify the branches from the undotree() function?
  (currently we are cheating and take only the items from the undolist into account
- make tags permanent (needs patch for Vim)
- rewrite script and make use of undotree() functionality that is available since Vim 7.3 (should work now)
- Bugfix: Sometimes the histwin window contains invalid data, not sure how to reproduce it. Closing and reoping is the workaround.
